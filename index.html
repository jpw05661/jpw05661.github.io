	<td><p> My name is Jackson Wadsworth and I am a 3rd year Agribusiness/Agriculural and Applied Economics major at <b>UGA</b>.</p>
	<p> I am an ambassador for the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as the president of my fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho.</p>
	<p> During the week I am usually pretty busy with school, as I am taking a full course load and have various ambassador and fraternity</p>
	<p>related responsibilities to handle on a day-to-day basis.</p>
	<p> On the weekends, my roommates and I like to grill and hangout on our front lawn. We usually play lawn games like cornhole and bring</p>
	<p> a speaker to listen to music.</p>

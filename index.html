	<td><H3>About me</H3>
	<p> My name is Jackson Wadsworth and I am a 3rd year Agribusiness/Agriculural and Applied Economics major at <b>UGA</b>.
	I am an ambassador for the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, as well as the president of my fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho.
	During the week I am usually pretty busy with school, as I am taking a full course load and have various ambassador and fraternity
	related responsibilities to handle on a day-to-day basis.
	On the weekends, my roommates and I like to grill and hangout on our front lawn. We usually play lawn games like cornhole and bring
	a speaker to listen to music.</p>
		<p> My favorite songs to listen to right now are:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Ragweed - Koe Wetzel</li>
	<li>Nose on the Grindstone - Tyler Childers</li>
	<li>Fast as You - Dwight Yoakam</li>
	</ol>
	<p>After this school year I am hoping to get a summer internship with Syngenta, which is a huge international agricultural company
	that specializes in crop protection. After graduation I am hoping to get on with a company like Syngenta, or work in agrifinance
	with a company like AgSouth and do crop insurance or farm credit type work. I would love to be able to travel around for work in my
	early twenties, but the end goal is to end up back in the Southeast to settle down.</p>
